# AI iMessage

Chat with AI with an iMessage-like UI using [Hugging Face AI](https://huggingface.co/).

## Getting Started

Create a `.env.local` file by duplicating `env.example` and renaming the duplicated file.

Grab a API token from Hugging Face, first by [registering a new account](https://huggingface.co/join) and then going into your [token settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
